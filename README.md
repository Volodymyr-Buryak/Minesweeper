## 📖 Description
**Minesweeper** is a classic logic game created as part of the first practical project. The goal is to reveal all cells on the board without triggering any mines.
In this version, the board contains **8 mines**. Players can use flags to mark suspected mines, and numbers on opened cells show how many mines are adjacent to that cell.
