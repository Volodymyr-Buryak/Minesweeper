## Description


**Minesweeper** is a classic logic game created as part of a practical project. The goal is to reveal all cells on the board without triggering any mines.  

In this version, the board contains **8 mines**. Players can use flags to mark suspected mines, and numbers on opened cells show how many mines are adjacent to that cell.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.
